# First-Neural-Network
An example of a Neural Network and how it work. We are taking a real database to do it. And I have added notes to make it as clear as possible.
The data comes from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset and will be attached here as an other document. This data shows storical data for a Bike sharing business.
